# My Values

### Wisdom
I am always looking for better ways of doing things.  I am a voracious reader and I meet regularly meet with people with more wisdom and experience than myself.

### Discipline
I am disciplined and physically fit.  I am orderly in person and in work, and I plan tomorrow's work today. I am not the type of person that presses the snooze button.

### Leadership
I give clear vision and direction to the people I work with so they can apply their unique strengths to make desired outcomes happen. I appreciate and bring out the best in people, and I redirect credit to where it is due.  I am ultimately responsible for all failures made by my subordinates.

### Altruism
I care more about making a difference than making money.  I know my success in life is dependent on how many people I help and by the magnitude in which I help them.

### Optimism
I always maintain a positive attitude. I do not make excuses. I always maintain responsibility for myself and my actions. I take risks and challenge myself to grow every day.
